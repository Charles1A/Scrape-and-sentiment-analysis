2024-04-30,4,"Great location, Friendly staffs 5 stars but food was too salty for our taste...we tried omakaze but should have tried individual menus.  Overall great experience"
2024-04-30,4,"Ambience is great, wait time is awful, (Service) is OK, food was not that good this time"
2024-04-29,1,"Worst service of all time. Even with a reservation, they'll still treat you like dog shit. And the food is nothing special. Go to Sushi Fumi in West Hollywood."
2024-04-29,4,The food is ok -- overpriced sushi which is what Nobu is known for.  What makes this place particularly special (and the best Nobu IMHO) is the location.  Right on the beach with a fun celebrity or two once in a while.
2024-04-26,5,"Exceptional outstanding quality, well done service and absolutely fantastic customer service with a great ambiance. The food was so fresh as always, delicious, delinquent, and definitely piece of art. Highly recommended"
2024-04-25,5,My husband and I sat at the sushi bar and they were so attentive and accommodating! The food was absolutely amazing
2024-04-25,4,Came here years later and the food has improved. The monkfish pate and sushi is delicious! Still pretty expensive but the service is very high end with a relaxed view. Ate here a few times but getting a reservation is reliable if you eat here often enough. Coming here is great for a nice treat.
2024-04-21,5,"The food, the views, the vibes were all amazing (of course) but what stood out for us was the service. Our server Kardell was absolutely fabulous - he was on point with his suggestions and curated an entire 9-courses for us. Kardell was also friendly, warm and very attentive even though he was very busy as the restaurant was packed. We felt lucky to be seated right by the ocean so our view of the ocean was top notch. Love our dinner experience here!"
2024-04-21,5,"Everything was amazing i was able to get last minute , front desk were very friendly, server was very friendly and knowledgeable.. Food was very good , Albacore sashimi, lemon meyer sashimi, crispy tuna rice was soo fresh!! Drinks were pretty great as well!"
2024-04-20,3,"i will never forget my experience of ordering an old fashioned (after having a manhattan) and being asked by the waiter if i know i'm ordering something different. ""you know that's not the same drink, right?"" my spidey senses tell me that the same question wouldn't have been asked to a man. overall though, not worth the hype. their speciality cocktails are nice."
2024-04-20,5,Great foodAmazing viewsExcellent staff with prompt service Mushroom appetizer was out of this world Chocolate match dessert was too good
2024-04-17,1,worst experience ever coming here. I called and made reservations and SPECIFICALLY requested for an outside table with the view for my birthday lunch. They mentioned to me that it was something they could accommodate me and they would include that request on the notes. I was so excited to take pictures with my son and my husband and spend a really nice lunch and one of the main reasons I wanted to come here. As we arrived the hostess mentioned to us they only have inside tables available Not the outside table as I requested. They said the outside tables are requested MONTHS in advance and they don't have any tables available. I said the only reason I made reservations at this restaurant was because of the outside table and because when I called they said they would accommodate me otherwise I would've made reservations somewhere else. I was told specially I would be accomadaded for the outside table and the host was really rude and said there's nothing they can do about it and could only give us the inside table. At this point I was furious! And left I had no choice but but to ear the table inside. As we sat down I tried my best to enjoy my time with my son and husband and for the FIRST TIME HERE and for the price  I was expecting the food to be amazing. We ordered the wary tacos and they were cold. The lobster cheese tasted super fishy and salty. overall I would say this place is OVERRATED! for the service and food and how the lie to you about the outside seated I wouldn't recommend this place or come here again. I would rather spend my money somewhere else with a view of the ocean. Plus as we were eating throughout our lunch we noticed empty tables by the ocean view the whole time we were there.
2024-04-15,5,"Food, Service, ambience was great! The yellowtail Sashimi Jalapeño was phenomenal! Everything we ate was the best of the best! The best birthday dinner I've ever had so far."
2024-04-15,3,"Really overpriced food for what you get. Service is meh. Sushi was fantastic though. Views of the ocean are very nice, so nice ambience. But so many other great Japanese restaurants to support in LA area."
2024-04-12,4,"Please note: even upon reserving over the phone a month in advance and requesting for a couch seat (hint: NEAR the ocean/railing) I guess they won't actually give it to you. I wish the person over the phone indicated that, but rather, told me that it would be closed if it was raining. I had to take off a star for that because we traveled from NorCal for this and the nice weather with no true ocean view and sort of dampened my experience. Rather, we were given a weird cushioned booth with an ocean view initially obstructed by a big party. We arrived 15+ minutes early and I inquired with the hostess about the couch and she said ""We have couch seating ready for you now"" which was... the cushioned booth. Ugh. Unlike me and my mistake PLEASE make it clear with the restaurant upon reserving that you want couch seating **NEXT TO THE OCEAN/RAILING. How sad for me. Onto the food, I have been to the Nobu Palo Alto location a handful of times and the Malibu location blows them out of the water. The drinks here are much sweeter and the menu is much more appealing here. They are cognizant of allergies and they really know how to make a good presentation.TLDR; be clear you want the couch seating by the ocean or railing. Not cushioned seating away from the water."
2024-04-11,5,Gorgeous views and restaurant. Food was also amazing!! Service was incredible. There were so many people responsible for checking on you.
2024-04-07,5,Called about two weeks ahead and was able to make a lunch reservation for four. We brought our two littles and luckily there were a few other kids at that time. We sat outside and the view was perfect. Everything was delicious. Can't remember the drink names but they were great including a cucumber spritzer not pictured. Service was great!
2024-04-07,5,"We can't say enough about Nobu. I'm a native of California and had never been here. Friends were visiting California and Nobu was on their bucket list. Thank god! What a beautiful spot directly on the beach. It was a rainy day, so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor seating, but it was an experience I will never forget. Amazing everything! Service, food, ambiance all of it. Noise level was not an issue and that is something that I appreciate when dining."
2024-04-02,5,"Wow wow wow! Where to start? I came to celebrate my friend's birthday and immediately we all fell in love with it. Unfortunately we hit traffic on our way to the restaurant and I frantically called the restaurant we will be 30 minutes late to the reservation. Fortunately, they were understanding and kept our reservation. I am forever grateful for their kindness. The food was bomb and there's plenty of places to take pictures. My fave food was miso soup, crunchy rolls and taco. I will definitely come back in the future."
2024-04-01,5,"01/06/24- Great views, great food, and great ambiance. Honestly, all of the hype is real in regard to Nobu Malibu.  Food:Yellowtail Jalapeño: 10/10 all the hype is real with this dish. The yellow tail is the freshest I've tasted. King Crab Tempura Amazu: 9/10 a great hot dish to share All of the cut rolls were also great and light."
2024-03-30,5,"The food, location and service justifies the price of everything. The food is great, the location is great, and everyone should take an opportunity to enjoy."
2024-03-30,2,Very pretentious. Waiters are rude. Food wasn't all that great. Very expensive but you already know that.
2024-03-30,1,My husband and I used to go to Nobu all the time before it moved to their new location. After the move we continued to go but it became the hangout for the rich and famous. Soon after nothing was available and you were sent to the wait list.
2024-03-26,4,"I would have loved to rate Nobu a 5 star. The host was extremely welcoming. The waiter was so friendly and made us feel right at home. However, the amount of stares from others as me and my friends walked in and out from the bar, and sat to eat, was uncomfortable. I still get surprised when as Latinos/Latinas, born in the Unite States, walk into a room and every Caucasian person turns and stares as if we don't belong."
2024-03-24,1,"I'm a disappoint about the service and respect from workers the biggest problem, parking spot and valet people they are super rude"
2024-03-21,5,"Nobu offers a consistent experience across the globe but the Malibu location is special.  It's worth the trip.  The ocean front setting is incredible and the energy is high -- even on a random Tuesday night when we were there most recently.  It's fun to people watch.  I didn't recognize any celebs but the crowd was fabulous.  My go-to favorites are the artichoke salad, modern sashimi (salmon), and rock shrimp tempura.Insider's Tip: Reservations are a pain, but call at 10am one month in advance as instructed on their website.  Be patient.  Bar seating is first come, first serve - maybe you'll get lucky!"
2024-03-20,4,"People might say it's overrated but you can't deny it's the best sushi in the Los Angeles area. It's going to be impossible to order something that is not good here. All the food is top notch and presentation lives up to their high standards and great reputation. The reason I give this place only 4 stars are for reasons other than the food. I have absolutely no complaints about the food and the price, but there are other reasons I choose to not come here regularly. First, you have to make a reservation way an advance to get a table which is annoying because sometimes you crave a certain meal the day of. It's unlikely to get a table the day of but try it. Second, it's annoying to think you are going to go out and have a relaxing, romantic dinner but you show up and it is SO LOUD! Luckily, when we went last month we got to sit near the outdoor area and we could hear the ocean a little bit but WOW was it loud, and we went on a Tuesday. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor is lovely with the amazing scenery but it's kind of a waste when you sit down at a small cramped table (unless you're a celebrity which you might get more space) and have to hear loud talking and silverware clanking. I get it, it's a top of the line restaurant which will make it busy and noisy but this is the reason why I choose other sushi places to go on a regular instead of Nobu. Again, I highly doubt you can find better sushi than this place it's just the other stuff that annoys me."
2024-03-20,5,"Excellent service and food. Outdoor would be much better. The wine paired with the food was recommended by my waiter, which s fabulous."
2024-03-18,5,One of the best Japanese restaurants i've been to! The restaurant vibe is perfect. The sashimi and crispy rice was by far the best!
2024-03-17,2,"The food was good, the ambiance was nice, it's very beautiful. Our service was not good at all. We were significantly neglected, had to ask many times for a drink menu, and were never checked on. Half of our food did not come out, and we had to remind the server that we did not receive half of what we ordered. Additionally, we never saw the same server more than twice, which is part of the issue. The staff were not communicative amongst themselves."
2024-03-07,4,"Similar to another person's review that it is not worth the hype that this place gets. But definitely a fun experience none the less. We had the table side tasting menu where our server would pick out recommendations and things that were popular. He catered to any preferences and allergies for the table and made it according to a rough budget we were looking to spend. Started with three different orders of sashimi,Tuna and wagyu tacos, miso cod, king crab tempura, shrimp tempura with creamy sauce, sea bass with miso,  ribeye with truffle sauce. All the sashimi tasted good. Our sea bass was a bit over cooked on one side of the fish. But still tasted good. The king crab wouldn't personally get again. The sauce tasted like sweet and sour mixed with vinegar. The shrimp dish would also not recc compared to everything else (personally feel like walnut shrimp tastes better). I think everything was overall good. No new flavors, all relatively familiar if you've had Filipino, Japanese, Chinese food before. But I think the overall experience and ambiance was still exciting. Getting things served individually and having them go over each of the courses."
2024-03-05,5,"Looking for the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion, Nobu should be your go to spot! The ambiance is beautiful and the vibe inside exudes tasteful fun for ages 21+, however kids & dogs are allowed. My waiter was amazing and fun was delicious. My favorite 2 dishes was the jalapeño yellowtail & the toro tuna. Their raw fish is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. However I wasn't a fan of the tempura shrimp, it lacked flavor & under the tempura the shrimp were small. None the less, it was a great dining experience."
2024-03-05,5,"My experience here was pretty epic. We came here as a group of 8 for my bachelor party. The waiter mentioned that this Nobu was Japanese/Peruvian. We ordered the omakase but some add ins for large groups. I've only eaten at the Nobu in Hong Kong which was also very memorable. This location has an epic location with views of the Pacific, but the only issue was the rain we experienced that night. Initially, I wanted to arrive early 1830 in order to capture sunset views but the weather did not cooperate. The food came out at a good pace, never having to wait long for the next dish to come out. When I left to use the bathroom, someone came over to fold my napkin. My glass of water was always filled. Service was definitely top notch. The food was also excellent. Some of the extra bougie courses were the A5 Wagyu and the uni. There wasn't really a bad course, surprisingly. I would definitely come back again, when the sun's out."
2024-03-05,2,"You're paying for the atmosphere, not the food. Malibu is beautiful, the spot on the beach is beautiful, the ambience of the restaurant is also very upscale and beautiful. The food was pretty bad, honestly. The spicy garlic edamame, which you usually can never go wrong with, were way too spicy and seemed like they were just bathed in Sriracha. The charred Brussels sprouts were beyond charred - they were burnt, soggy, and way overcooked. All of the sushi rolls had way too much rice, making them enormous in diameter and not able to be eaten in a single bite. The lobster tacos were laughable - literally, we laughed when they were placed on the table. They are very tiny - eaten in a single bite - and quite frankly were pretty unpleasant looking as they very closely resembled part of the female anatomy. Overall, I'd go again if somebody else was paying just to enjoy a leisurely lunch on the patio in the sunshine. If I were to be sitting inside, I'd say you're better off at PF Chang."
2024-03-04,1,"Service sucks the food is average and overpriced they try to rip u off every way possible very disappointed in the quality and service, do better"
2024-03-02,5,"Nobu Malibu is a culinary gem that offers an unforgettable dining experience. The staff's recommendations are spot-on, ensuring every dish is a delight. From the signature Black Cod Miso to the Yellowtail Jalapeño, each bite is a culinary masterpiece."
2024-02-27,1,"Extremely condescending attitudes from host stand for no reason. We waited for over 40 minutes for our table. They made us wait outside in the cold. Food was mediocre. Our waitress was sweet, & did a great job, however the hosts were so rude it ruined the experience. We've been regulars for a long time & will no longer be giving our business. We spent thousands of dollars on this last dinner to have rude""hosts"" tell us we can't split the bill amongst 3 people in the group. Then proceeded to tell us to be quiet in the bar area, (spending more money on drinks) that is always packed & loud, while the restaurant is still crowded. it's Nobu Malibu, it could pass as a pre party for club goers, in fact, that's exactly what this place is. There is ZERO hospitality. Don't go here expecting it!! After all, research shows the manager was sexually assaulting employees & there's been countless other reviews on how awful the hosts are. GREAT SPOT"
2024-02-27,5,"I had the pleasure of dining here during a work event, and while I acknowledge that my experience might be slightly biased due to the sampling of various dishes on the menu and going for a work event, I can confidently say that every bite was a delight.From the hamachi and yellowtail tuna to the grilled shishito peppers, each dish was great. Despite Nobu's reputation for their Black Cod, I found that other dishes were better for me. From the great service and experience, I suggest opting for a family-style dining approach, as I did, allows to explore and appreciate a wider range of flavors and textures that Nobu has to offer.I'm surprised but I definitely recommend Nobu Malibu to anyone seeking an unforgettable dining experience."
2024-02-26,3,"While Nobu Malibu stands as a beacon of upscale dining, its current menu might benefit from a refresh to keep pace with Los Angeles's dynamic culinary scene. The legendary miso cod undoubtedly remains a must-try, showcasing Nobu's ability to create memorable dishes. However, for sushi enthusiasts looking for innovation, perhaps introducing elements like dry-aged fish could infuse new life into the menu, offering a richer, more nuanced flavor experience that keeps guests coming back for more. Additionally, the challenge of securing a reservation poses a significant barrier to entry. Given this, diners might find themselves exploring other venues where the combination of accessibility and culinary innovation makes for a more appealing dining experience."
2024-02-25,5,"""Expectation is the root of all heartache"" is a quote I've learned the hard way when it comes to trying restaurants like Nobu Malibu.... and in other areas of life but I'm not tryna trauma dump on here.The Carbones and the Peter Lugers of the world let me down far more often than not, as I'm expecting to be BLOWN away by them. I think it's a mix of my expectations being near impossible to meet, and these businesses know that people will come just off of the hype alone, so it's hard to stay locked in.For context, my girlfriend was coming to LA for the first time and her one and only request was to go to Nobu Malibu, even quoting the Drake line ""Eatin crab out in Malibu at Nobuuuuuu"" smh.After calling and trying to make a res 24 days in advance, we were put on the waitlist. By the time our trip came around, I was hinting to pookie that God may just not want us to go.... but she said we could go right when it opens and could probably get a seat at the bar.I understood the low probability of this, but thought a spiritual drive up to Malibu would be worth it anyways. Plus, you try telling pookie no. Pookie gets what pookie wants.After the beautiful 58 minute drive from Manhattan Beach filled with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and BlueBucksClan spilling out my Toyota Rav4 speakers, we arrived at the promised land.The valet parks my 2017 Rav4 between a matte G-Wagon and a big body Range, and we walk through the beautiful little courtyard lounge area with the Pacific Ocean maybe 20 feet from us to get to the entrance.We get in at 11:59am (it opens at noon), and it is already PACKED. I was like baby no way we gettin a seat ahahaha...I was ready to just grab an early drink and enjoy the elite ambiance and head up to Point Dume for a meal.We got to the host stand and I put on my best puppy dog eyes, and the host says a table may open up, but we can sit at the bar as there is a full menu. She points over my right shoulder to the bar, and it is completely empty lol. Pookie was right.Before we could even order a drink, the hostess comes up to us and says a table opened up as someone canceled a res. WE UP!I don't even really need to say this, but this ambiance is everything it is cracked up to be. Whatever you're thinking in your head, it's even better. Waves crashing, sun shining. An absolute spiritual experience.We were buzzin that we got in, so we ordered a FEAST: Edamame & Shishito Peppers to start (do both I promise), Spicy Yellowtail Jalapeño, Crispy Rice w Spicy Tuna, Wagyu Tacos, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Black Miso Cod, Spicy Tuna Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Baked Crab Roll.The quality of food at Nobu is just on a whole different level. It really is artistry what they are doing in here. Every bite we would look at each other like DAMN THIS IS HITTIN. Our favorites were the Yellowtail Jalapeño, Crispy Rice, and Black Cod. Those 3 dishes are like the Heatles. Yellowtail Jalapeño is LeBron though.I need to shout out my man Brett, our server. He was delivering the type of service you would expect here. Engaging, funny, and knows the menu like the back of his hand. Just one of those dudes who is happy to be alive and those kinds of people are infectious.Yeah, it's expensive. A special occasion only type beat. Being well north of $400 after a couple drinks each, my pockets were on featherweight. However, it was an experience we will talk about for years to come...and that's exactly what I was paying for. The experience. It is something we will always have together.To me, life is all about stacking these types of experiences with the people that you love and the people that love you. You can't take it with you. So yeah, it was easily worth it.In closing, I can't help but equate Nobu Malibu to LeBron James. The weight of the world on his shoulders, dubbed ""The next Michael Jordan"" and ""The Chosen One"" at age 16 comes with a level of expectation that could only set him up to fail. Yet, he still blew them out of the water. LeNobu.IG @jnov_Tiktok @jnov__"
2024-02-24,3,"Nobu is no Matsuhisa.   It's more glitz and glam and far less substance.   There's an amazing view and it's a place to be seen, so the ambiance within the restaurant is quite loud and hectic.  The refinement of a true sushi restaurant is plastered with a layer of cheese that is more befitting of Vegas. The food was really good, but not at the level you would expect from Nobu.  The refinement wasn't there. The servers were trying to serve up a wow-factor more befitting a car dealership.  Again the food was great, but the experience could not justify the cost of the meal."
2024-02-22,5,"As expected, amazing experience with top notch service, delicious food & drinks and the best ambiance! Our server John was very welcoming, familiar with the many menu options & he suggested the best choices even items that weren't on the menu but that had the Nobu Chef's touch! The friendly staff always made sure any empty dishes were quickly removed. John & Lino made my first time here a night to remember with their excellent service! The drinks were perfectly delicious including the espresso martini & the specialty drink! I already have reservations to celebrate my daughters upcoming birthday so she can also experience everything Nobu has to offer!"
2024-02-21,4,"We made the reservation during lunch hours, so we were able to enjoy the sunset scenery. My advice would be to request a table outside by the balcony for the best experience. Our server was very pleasant and had a lot of recommendations for food and drinks. In terms of food, we have been to the Los Angeles location before and the food is pretty much the same thing. The scenery really elevates the dining experience."
2024-02-19,5,"We came for my boyfriend's birthday and it was spectacular! Unfortunately the rain and gloom blocked the ocean side views but everything else was good enough to make up for it! Our server Kardell was the highlight! His kindness and recommendations were top tier. He guided us through the menu and we tried some amazing new dishes thanks to him, specifically the Chilean seabass, albacore and Meyer lemon, and ribeye with truffle butter (so good we got two!).  He helped me surprise my bf with a birthday dessert and personalized message as well! Definitely sit with him if you can as he made our dinner that much more special!"
2024-02-19,5,"To no one's surprise, this place is nothing short of absolute perfection. I drove from San Diego to Malibu to have lunch here for my 25th birthday. Despite, the 4 hour drive back this was the highlight of my day. The service was fantastic and view was even better. For starters we ordered the crispy okra and edamame. The crispy okra was so so good. Even my friend who isnt a fan of okra, loved these ones. The edamame was lackluster compared to everything else we had that day. I ordered the mango and passion martini - 10/10 bright tropical flavors i could have 10 of these. As well as the elderflower and lychee martini which was also a 10/10 - lychee forward and absolutely incredible. I ordered the omakase. Absolutely no complaints, the whole experience was life changing and my favorite dish would have to the ribeye steak with truffle sauce. Its the type of bite that has your eyes roll back. For dessert, we had these dessert cigars and of course the one included in the omakase. Both of these were solid desserts, but nothing to write home about. The ""happy birthday Zana"" written with chocolate was a thoughtful touch. Although there are other Nobu locations, some far closer to me in literal San Diego Gaslamp, there is something about this location that stands out amongst the others. From the food, the views, drinks...its truly worth the hype."
2024-02-16,3,We ordered drinks and they were definitely the highlight of the meal. We also ordered about 4 hot seafood items and a handful of sushi items as well as some appetizers.Everything was either good or just okay. You're definitely paying for the view because the food is nothing to rave about. I didn't dislike anything either it's just that nothing was very impressive or stood out. Either something was too salty or not flavored enough and bland. Also I asked our server for some lemons four times and I asked another server as well when our server wasn't around and finally by the fifth time they brought lemons which was during the last 15 minutes of our meal. No apology and zero sense of awareness for asking so many times... it was strange. Must be a lemon shortage I'm unaware of? Overall it was just an okay experience.
2024-02-13,3,"Not worth the hype in my opinion. If you are going to do simple but super fresh ingredients that's cool but the food wasn't any better than what I get at most local sushi places. The drinks weren't all that good either. The ambience was my favorite part but wouldn't fight the crowds, prices, or drive to go again."
2024-02-13,5,"It's so amazingly delicious, if I had a last meal, this would be it!!! The truffle butter steak, Dover sole, artichoke salad and passion fruit semifreddo are to-die-for!  Thank you, Nobu!!  Plus, you can't beat the ambiance! 20 out of 10 stars."
2024-02-09,1,"Called the host stand while right across from the restaurant to see if there was availability. Host said there was no wait. While crossing the street I could see no one else had entered the restaurant, but to my surprise when I checked in at the host stand I was unexpectedly told the wait would be an hour and a half. I mentioned that I had just called and the rude host (tall with black hair) responded with a blatant lie that other guests had arrived. (Again, not one car entered the parking the lot in between my call and entering the restaurant). I was particularly disappointed because I am a big nobu fan and I have been to this specific location several times prior and have always had a great experience. I was not upset that there was a wait as that is to be expected as a walk in at Nobu, I was frustrated by the lying and the fact that the wait seemed to depend on the appearance of the guests. I ended up sitting at the sushi bar and the service was great as expected, however I am discouraged to return based on the interaction at the host stand. The host was very rude and dismissive, and definitely appeared to be offering preferential treatment. I think she forgot that she works at the place and doesn't own it. She was giving off a sense that she was better than us and definitely was unaware of the fact that I have come here frequently and was looking forward to share my fondness of Nobu Malibu with my friend who was visiting. Disappointing to say the least."
2024-02-02,2,"We tried the Omasake menu 2 years ago and was impressed by the quantity and qaulity.  This time in our 2nd try of Omasake, it was quite mediocre.  Not only they increased the price from $100 to $135, they also reduced the quality of their raw fish and hot dish."
2024-01-31,1,"It was my 60th birthday. My family decided to take me out. among all the restaurants in Los Angeles. We choose to come to Nobu because we were there twice five years ago, and we loved it.But this time It was one of the worst experience we had.The sushi  was not fresh, had no flavor, the rice was dry, we asked for Ginger he brings us a  plate with an attitude.I don't recommend this place it's a ripoff, and it's overrated literally the sushi tasted like I got it from a vending machine at Ralphs ."
2024-01-31,5,So beautiful and great service. The food was amazing. Treatment was amazing. One of  my favorite restaurant
2024-01-26,4,"Finally got to visit this famed location. I think it goes without saying how popular this place is. You can tell by the presence of the paparazzi outside waiting to catch a vip for a photo op. This was our second stop on our PCH recon day. I highly recommend getting a resy, but since all we wanted was a drink we were totally ok with hanging at the bar area where people were watching the Sunday game. We ended up enjoying our drink outside which as it turned out was the waiting area. We decided to only get one round. I actually did enjoy the vibe outside and would have stayed longer, but the service was kinda spotty. I asked a guy outside to wind up the umbrella since the sun was scorching and his response was he had to go ask a manager to do it and that it would probably take a while. I think we stayed a little over a half hour and no one came back to our area. Two of us tried to do it ourselves, but the thing was so heavy."
2024-01-25,4,"In case you didn't know what to expect with this, you are paying for the gorgeous setting and the ambience. Perched directly overlooking the lapping ocean waves of Malibu, the California Sun seems to stay in the top of the sky forever.They have the most beautiful terrace deck, with comfortable couch seating, and the bar and lounge area have an indoor outdoor feel with giant glass walls and large sliding doors that are always open. We started with drinks, I tried the Flor de Jamaica, and absolutely loved it. It had a spicy red salt rim, not sure what type but not tajin, and had a deep red flavor with spicy hibiscus and deliciously smooth Anejo tequila inside. It came poured over a single large square ice cube that had the restaurant's logo born into it. Beautiful. My friend tried the qui espresso, their take on an espresso martini but with tequila and cold brew and orange bitters. I loved it, she wasn't a fan. The sushi itself was good but nothing to write home about. The prices are for the setting, point blank. Still I'll be back. Loooved this location. And the drinks were yum. Also we saw pierce brosnan a few tables over! We ran into him outside after & He was cool."
2024-01-25,5,"Amazing food!! Very aesthetic, Staff was lovely would definitely come back! Perfect place to celebrate any occasion!"
2024-01-24,4,"Nobu sushi is always top tier. I like that there are certain things only available at this location, like the truffle oil/black salt salmon which we ordered 3 more rounds of. I do feel like the service at this location wasn't as good as other locations I've visited - our table was reserved for outside but they made us sit inside which was a bummer, but overall good experience."
2024-01-23,5,"AMAZING!! Ronny and Joel are the best, such an amazing person and makes you feel so so welcomed! They have such a warm heart and cannot explain how much our group loved him!!"
2024-01-20,5,"The food was great as always, had a reservation and was seated promptly. The service was on par as usual as well the servers always paying attention to detail which is appreciated. You'll never have to ask for plates to be taken or room be made on the table, that being said you will never feel rushed it's all timed perfectly and makes the experience enjoyable. My staples that I'd recommend are the yellowtail sashimi, Wagyu tacos and shrimp or lobster tempura (go creamy sauce *chefs kiss*) for drinks all there martinis are very refreshing. The environment is private/ cozy yet still upbeat with noise from the music/ kitchen and others around you. Today it was raining so no view to the ocean unfortunately. Overall great experience, my only complaint is that at reservation and at check in I wasn't asked if there was a special occasion (which is almost asked at every restaurant) and I did not find the time to let my server know that I was celebrating a 5 year anniversary. Small miss on attention to detail otherwise great as always."
2024-01-19,5,"Beyond the Beach: An Insider's Glimpse into Nobu Malibu's Esoteric DelightsMalibu isn't just a sun-kissed haven for celebrities and surfers; it's the backdrop for a select few who savor the exquisite, the exclusive. And at the heart of this culinary Eden lies Nobu Malibu, a temple of opulence where the ocean serenades your soul and sushi becomes an art form.For me, Nobu Malibu is more than just a restaurant; it's a sanctuary. Stepping through the sleek doors is like entering a hushed Zen temple, where minimalist lines whisper promises of refined indulgence. The endless turquoise canvas of the Pacific stretches before you, punctuated by the rhythmic dance of yachts and the melodic whisper of crashing waves. It's an ambiance that washes away the stresses of the world, preparing you for the symphony of flavors to come.The menu, itself a whispered poetry of fresh-from-the-ocean treasures, caters to a discerning palate. Yellowtail sashimi, like sunlit pearls glistening on a black lacquer plate, melts on your tongue with a delicate interplay of sweetness and brine. Toro, the crown jewel of tuna, explodes on your palate with a creamy richness that defies description. Each bite is a journey to the heart of the Pacific, a testament to the chef's meticulous sourcing and exquisite artistry.And artistry it is. The nigiri is a masterclass in balance, each piece of perfectly formed rice a pedestal for the jewel atop. Wasabi, mere whispers of green fire, enhances the flavors without overpowering them. It's a testament to the chef's deep understanding of seafood, where every element exists in perfect harmony.But Nobu is more than just sushi. Black cod, bathed in a miso glaze that shimmers like molten gold, flakes apart to reveal the most divine sweetness. The lobster tempura, light as a feather yet bursting with juicy flavor, is a testament to the chef's deft touch. Each dish is a mini-opera of taste and texture, leaving you breathless with its audacity and finesse.The service, too, is an art form. Servers glide through the dining room like shadows, anticipating your every need before you even voice it. They are connoisseurs of both the menu and the human experience, weaving a tapestry of attentive service and genuine warmth. It's a subtle dance of recognition, where familiar faces are greeted with a knowing smile and a personalized recommendation.As the sun dips below the horizon, casting the sky in a fiery blush, the restaurant takes on a new persona. The soft glow of lanterns dances on the water, transforming the space into an intimate haven for those in the know. It's the perfect setting for indulging in the final act of this epicurean masterpiece - the legendary Nobu cheesecake.This is no ordinary dessert. It's a symphony of textures - a creamy, melt-in-your-mouth filling contrasted by a crisp, buttery crust. Each bite is a decadent explosion of sweet and tangy, the perfect harmony to conclude this epicurean odyssey.Nobu Malibu isn't just a meal; it's a passport to exclusivity, a whispered secret shared amongst those who appreciate the finer things. It's a portal to a world where luxury meets artistry, where every bite is a poem, and every detail a brushstroke on the canvas of perfection. It's a memory that lingers long after the last bite, a reminder that true gastronomy is more than sustenance; it's an art form for the soul.So, if you seek an experience that transcends the ordinary, a symphony of flavors that will dance on your palate long after the curtain falls, make your way to Nobu Malibu. Let the ocean breeze caress your skin, the music wash over you, and the culinary artistry astound you. It's a journey you'll savor, a taste of luxury that will forever redefine your expectations of what a meal can be. And who knows, perhaps you'll find yourself joining the select few who call this their sanctuary, who return not just for the food, but for the whispers of exclusivity and the shared love of an esoteric culinary Eden.Signed,Brian Chee"
2024-01-18,5,"When I was in college, I used to go to Matsuhisa, and sit in front of Nobu himself. Quite difficult to re-create such an experience, but my visit to Nobu Malibu was pretty astonishing last week. The manager had invited one of my good friends and we got a little bit of special treatment. What strikes me about this experience is a combination of the texture in my mouth of a perfectly cut slice of fish, just the right amount of ingredients to not confuse the senses, the sunlight, and the smell of the sea. I literally shed a tear at one point, and I proceeded to go home and re-create as many of the dishes as I could remember. When you go here, try to eat slow and appreciate every one of your senses. No"
2024-01-17,5,"We were able to get a table at the bar without a reservation. The food was amazing- we had the miso cod along with several other dishes. Everything, including the drinks, was impressive!"
2024-01-17,4,"One word: expensive. But everything else: FABULOUS. The vibe really is where it's at here, the location right on PCH in Malibu facing the Pacific Ocean makes for incredible sunset views, and the openness of the restaurant (has open glass doors leading to the patio) makes it feel not cramped, despite the fact this place is ALWAYS full. We barely got a reservation the week we were going but we really wanted to try the food and I'm glad we got to! The hosts were very nice and helpful. Our server was also very nice, although he seemed a bit surprised by the amount we were ordering lol. We wanted to try a lot though since we knew we weren't coming back and it DEFINITELY added up. I had a lychee and elderflower cocktail that really tasted just like lychee (couldn't taste much elderflower) and it was STRONG. My date had a mocktail martini that I actually liked more than my drink since it was sweeter. We also ordered the coco shiso (2-3 pieces, $8), the omakase ($195 - most expensive thing on the menu but it came with like 8 courses including the dessert I had wanted to try), the ribeye with truffle butter ($54), the toro scallion (2-3 pieces, $24), the king crab uni ($98 - see pictures. And DONT confuse the little white piles the leg is on top of for grits - it is SALT lol, my date found out the hard way), and the wagyu tacos (2 pieces and they are TINY, like the size of your thumb so single bites - $36). Out total including tax and tip for all this was about $530, but we tried a huge selection of what they had to offer and we definitely left full. I don't know I would seek out coming here again just because of the food prices, but I would def come for drinks and to sit on the patio if a reservation were available and I were in the area!"
2024-01-12,5,"Review of the food and experience from my sister and her hubby. I treated them to Nobu Malibu for their 25th wedding anniversary since they were going to be in LA anyway, and I secretly wanted to dine here vicariously through them, lol!! Made the reservation less than a week before, and I was #19 on the line when I called. I was so surprised to get a table for 2 for a late lunch!  Everything was super easy to arrange with the hostess, and they followed up a day before the reservation.  These 2 are foodies and are very particular when it comes to seafood, so I was excited for their honest review.Service: 5/5 from the moment they were seated to the time they left. They never felt rushed, and the server took time to ask them for their preferences and explained every dish he served in detail. Server also recommended great cocktails with generous alcohol in each one.Food: 5/5 absolutely no complaints about the food which is rare for these two. They recommend the Omakase and sea urchin dish if they had to pick one dish each. The freshness and the sauces that perfectly complemented each dish made every bite so sumptuous, delectable, and unforgettable. The cocktails were very fruity, and they do not skimp on the alcohol!Honestly, I was so apprehensive when booking this place for them because they of course have heard of the restaurant, seen it on TV and know of its stellar reputation for premium food and I wanted to make sure they liked my anniversary treat for them.Worth the hype! Can't beat the freshness of the seafood, ambiance, view, and attentive service."
2024-01-09,5,"OMG. If you're looking to celebrate a special day, indulge in a CULINARY EXPERIENCE or an excuse to enjoy an amazing meal, with great service and ambiance this is the place to be! This was my first Omakase and Nobu experience and this was a 100 out 10! Getting there: The restaurant is situated right at the waterfront, so you have a beautiful (un hindered) view of the ocean; and they offer reasonable valet for $15 so getting to/from there is a breeze. Be sure to call in advance as they're usually booked out weeks with limited availability. The greeting staff is really sweet, but honestly I think our host/server (Rubin) made our experience even all that much better.Meal types/Menu: The food here is prepared in a few different styles (either hot or cold dishes -see menu pic) and served family style. For those dining individually, they can also opt for the tasting menu or Omakase (which contains 7 dishes for a price of $135 per person). I suggest before you order or dive into your menu, talk to your server and explain your group's food preferences, appetite and any restrictions. We initially wanted to order the omakasa for each individual but our server suggested that we trust him in picking a combination of hot and cold dishes (we got a total of 6 cold dishes; 4 hot dishes; 5 rolls and 4 dessert. All this was still much lower in cost per person than the Omakase option. Our food/what you should order: Now each Nobu may be a little different as they cater to and utilize local resources available for that season, so our menu options/experience may be different from yours. But regardless what you order or are surprised with, everything is of top quality and well superbly DELICIOUS! Below I have listed the dishes that were selected for us by our server, notable hints I remember and if I think you should order them:COLD DISHES 1. Yellow tail Sashimi with jalapeno and cilantro - YES this was fresh, kick of spice, juicy and very California and very fresh!2. Salmon miso with garlic and olive oil - YES:- this was an off the menu item. It was a fresh, crunchy and was a nice palette cleaner from #13. Albacore crispy onion (lightly seared) and ponzu. -YES: the ponzu sauce was AMAZING. I have never tried crispy onions with Albacore and well I was pleasantly surprised 4. Tai sweet shiso with crispy shotaki mushroom. -YES: the mushrooms and sauce combo on top of the shiso was amazing5. Fluke Sashimi with Dry Miso and Yuzu. -YES didn't know that the Soy salt with white fish with lime (Yuzu) can taste like this. The Peruvian totalito and ricotto added an amazing spicy kick that was just perfect! 6. Bigeye and Bluefin Toro Tartar Nobu. -YES: the tartar was placed in a crispy taco rice paper shell the texture blend was amazing.WARM DISHES1. Crispy Rice with tuna. -YES: it's tuna and crispy rice so you have to try2. Sea bass with spicy sauce. -YES: these bass bite sized poppers were a fusion take but omg so good. 3. Roasted Cauliflower in jalapeno sauce. -order only if you want to add some veggies to your meal. The cauliflower was parboiled and then roasted to perfection and lightly seasoned. 4. Black Cod with Miso. MUST TRY. The hype is real. This was by far the best Cod and best Miso dish I've ever tried. It had almost like a sweet teriyaki feel to it and the Cod was melts away. ROLLS 1. House special cut2. Spicy tuna cut (with Avocado and cucumber)3. Salmon/Avocado Cut4. Yellowtail Jala Cut 5. Spicy albacore cut roll PASS : By now our party was starting to feel full. So if you're like us I'd say skip on the rolls all together. I didn't think they were anything special except for the house special roll; the white casing was very different and light/fresh almost like a radish or jicama DESSERT 1. Bento box ( dense cake green tea gelato - OK TO PASS: the chocolate and green tea flavor Michu is not for me. 2. Banana soy caramel sauce. -YES: it was a hot/cold dessert,, but fur me it was really sweet and tasted like fresh bananas YUM3. Chocolate spring rolls: -PASS: the insides of the spring rolls wee abut soggy. 4. Assorted Mochi chocolate: ube: coconut -PASS: i think whoolfoods's has better flavor.OVERALLIf you're doing Nobu, you have to trust your serve. Remember to ask if they can let you know/inform you of what's coming next so you gauge and skip/add things before you're too full. I am extremely happy with my entire experience. Will definitely try other Nobu locations (but I doubt anything will top this one). Before coming here I thought this was a boujee thing I wouldn't understand; but I get it; the the quality; the techniques, portions and experience are totally worth the price and worth trying again. NOTE: We don't drink but I really enjoyed my mocktail: Hibiscus Fizz is worth a try"
2024-01-08,3,"Came to celebrate my birthday. Service was very good, food was good but not great. Atmosphere was also very good. We had a table on the patio, and despite the cold temperature, it was comfortable."
2024-01-07,1,"So bad, it was hilarious. Got the Omakase menu for two.8 courses. Maybe 3 good bites. ~$600 after tip and 1 drink each. A5 Wagyu was burnt so bad, the cow would be offended.One pair of disposable chopsticks for the entire meal. There were more Rolls Royce's in the Nobu parking lot than items of cutlery for our table. The music was about as classy as the chopsticks and so loud that conversation was impossible. I could see why the regulars like the place. The waiting staff seemed inconvenienced by their job. I've been in customer service, I get it. But, it would be nice if any of our 9 random rotating waiters pretended to care a little bit harder before a 10th new person put a scratched up card reader on my table and told me ""oh yeah and you tip here""Nobu Malibu is a good experience if you don't care about food, ambiance, or money.At least there is a McDonald's across the street."
2024-01-07,5,"Dining at Nobu Malibu took my breath and tastebuds away! In terms of experience, it lives up to the hype and is fine dining at its best. We called for a reservation a month in advance though you could also luck out for a walk-in bar spot. Even if you have to wait, the waiting area isn't your typical indoor bench. You're seated outdoors with couches overlooking the Pacific Ocean (with this vibe could I just come here sometimes with a coffee and enjoy the afternoon?). Time Out called Nobu Malibu the most beautiful waterfront restaurant in the world and the view does not disappoint! We were seated at the patio and so began the lovely Omakase lunch event of a delicious 7-course meal of 3 cold dishes, 3 hot dishes, and dessert. If it's your first time or a special occasion, I recommend going for the Omakase or Signature menu to get the full tasting experience - it's worth it! We were delighted with tartare with caviar, Peruvian oysters, truffle-sauce, fresh nigiri, and amazing flavors that I'd never tasted before. The Semifreddo with passion fruit, Malibu Coconut, and pistachio is just about the best dessert I've ever had.The waitstaff collaborated like a beautiful orchestra who came like clockwork to pour drinks, bring out and explain dishes, take away dishes and bus tables, and answer any requests. They were great about making dietary adjustments for pescatarian in place of red meat.The lunch tasting took about 2 hours and 15 minutes and valet parking is $15 or you can spend a few minutes looking for free street parking. Can't stop dreaming about Nobu Malibu!"
2024-01-04,5,"The food, service and ambiance is second to none. FYI please plan ahead and reserve, you'll be waiting for a while if your super hungry. Good thing for us, the wife and I got lucky and an elderly couple gave us there seats facing the ocean. We will definitely be visiting again."
2024-01-02,5,Food is amazing . Service was top notch. The ambiance is wonderful . Ocean view with waves crashing under you .
2024-01-02,4,"Atmosphere 5 stars (obviously) Service 5 starsDrinks 5 stars Food 3 stars :(Obvi this place is known for a place to go for an amazing meal when you want to celebrate but I was so disappointed by the actual food. We had a few stellar bites (ceviche, and rock shrimp, which are in the pictures) but we couldn't even eat one sushi roll because it was that terrible. Our waitress took it off the bill but expected more from Nobu status (and been to others - haven't had this experience). Will give it another shot sometime (as the views are epic and service was phenomenal) but super disappointed in the food at this visit."
2024-01-01,2,Overrated to the core. I heard this place got busted for selling different fish than they promise you. There was no wowing effect all that hype and money was not worth it there's local sushi places in woodman area that beat this place. D
2024-01-01,5,My son has wanted to try this restaurant for some time so we took him and some of his friends on his birthday weekend. The staff was friendly and our waitress was great. They got us seated right on time for our reservation despite being very busy on New Year's Eve day. We all loved the food. The restaurant and views were beautiful!! We will definitely be back
2023-12-28,5,"We are in Malibu for work and drove by Nobu and decided to call and see if we could get a reservation on a whim. The person answering the phone was so sweet and helpful, she told me they had no reservations available on the night I wanted to dine in but to call back between 4-5pm on the day of and check for cancellations and we were able to get in! We had the tempura rock shrimp, ribeye and the black cod with Miso for dinner and it was all amazing. So much flavor! To drink we had an old fashioned, flor de Jamaica (a little spicy) and the market margarita. It was to die for! Highly recommended for the food, service and ambiance. Our table was warm, the atmosphere and vibes were amazing and nothing beats hearing the waves crash while having dinner."
2023-12-28,5,"I've been going to Nobu Malibu for years and it's always fantastic! Went recently for my birthday with friends and everything was perfect! We had a little bit of everything but my favorite is the Rib Eye, delish.If you can get a table you won't be disappointed. Staff, food and ambiance is all amazing. A definite must if you're in Malibu."
2023-12-27,5,We love Nobu. What great food and room and service. The only negative is it's almost impossible to get in. We sit at the bar as usual and the view is unsurpassed in Malibu. The crowd is hip and trendy and almost impossibly young. LA at its finest....some people I know think that's a negative. I love the vitality and energy. It is pricey but hey the land alone is a fortune and so it is what it is. Everything we had today was stellar. I especially loved the Dover sole ~ omg incredible. The eggplant was amazing and all the sushi is top notch. Just an awesome place
2023-12-26,5,Always a stunning sunset at Nobu Malibu. I had a great time with my family and friends.
2023-12-23,5,"This is my favorite Nobu location out of all of the Nobu brand.  The ambience is always set to perfection as if this is Gods favorite location as well.  We especially enjoy outdoor seating for the ocean view.  Our server Money from Cambodia was amazingly attentive, efficient and effective at elevating our dining experience.  Everything we ordered was phenomenal.  If you like sushi, you have to give this location a try. The food is absolutely incredible. The chefs don't miss!! #NobuMalibu"
2023-12-23,5,"One word: EPIC! I had the best lunch ever! Imagine eating extremely sumptuous food, friendly staff/service, and a relaxing place - listening to the waves while sipping some champagne! For a foodie like me, this place is for those who want to try delicious food, blissful experience, and a bang for their buck!"
2023-12-20,5,Loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious. The view was spectacular and the weather was perfect.
2023-12-19,5,"Called Nobu Malibu for a party of 7 for a Monday, and was lucky enough to get reservations for this place last minute. We arrived early (an hour and a half early lol), to see if we could be accommodated earlier for the dinner reservation that we had and were seated right away. The service was amazing, and our waiter was very informative about the dishes they served. Let me just say, I had the prime filet toban yaki, wagyu tacos, shrimp tempora, and the ""xurro"" for dessert, and I couldn't believe the quality of their meat. It was cooked perfectly, and the xurro, which was cinnamon and dulce de leche, was the topping to a great dinner."
2023-12-18,4,"I have forgotten to leave this review for over a year- but the service we had was so exceptional, it's worth circling back. My fiancé and I were staying in Agoura Hills for the weekend and wanted to try NoBu for my birthday dinner, we knew the hype- and were up for the experience.  He made reservations a month before and it was a highlight we were looking forward to. When we first walked in the hostess was chilly then looked like she stepped in something smelly... we are kind of used to this when we go into touristy high end places, yet not treated this way in Michelin star places . Always interesting as a former chef who has worked next to some of the culinary greats, seeing which way the level of service will go. The table sucked, it was a tiny 2 seater put up against the windows of the patio. Small. Uncomfortable- definitely not a table I would have expected for a reservation made a month ahead of time. The restaurant wasn't full so that choice to seat us there could have been either the fact we didn't meet the hosts beauty standard, but I'll put it to just the seating rotation. At this point my expectations were lowering and it was looking like we were going to have a mediocre experience... until our server arrived . His attitude and genuine hospitality quickly changed our experience. I wrote his name somewhere - but I'll add his photo - so he gets the recognition he deserves.Our server guided us through the menu and our meal with the perfect balance of attention and letting us enjoy our tasting menu. We both got the tasting menu, I cannot remember if it was the omakase or not, but it was multiple courses and very filling. We did order up front the wagu tacos (which I have also ordered at NoBu in Newport recently) . They are small but pack so much flavor - it was worth it. While I cannot remeber every dish, I do recall everything being clean, perfect , fresh and in typical Japanese style subtle yet complex in taste. We did bring our own bottle of champagne, and it was kept chilled, and attentively poured. Our experience was great, mostly due to our server. Being from the Bay Area, we have had the opportunity to have several Omakase dinners and NoBu was up there. NoBu is all about the views. You can't beat it , if you get to be on the water. It's great people watching, and the food is fresh and clean. I recently went to the NoBu in Newport  with a friend for dinner. The vibe was very different, chill, attentive , low key, and the food was just as good: clean, delicious and beautiful. If I had to choose - I'd pick the Newport one again over Malibu. Maybe it's less of a tourist destination? Our table was better our view was beautiful and service was great. At the end of the day- our server made the night, made my birthday dinner, and should get an extra bonus or a raise."
2023-12-12,2,Too expensive. If you're looking to blow all your money and you have the money to blow and buy all means go eat here the food is great but I've never eaten it but that's what I've heard.
2023-12-09,3,"Came here for an anniversary and was able to get a table without a reservation, but I think because we went early at like 5pm on a Friday. Overall, nice ambiance, service, food and view. However, the quality of the food wasn't anything amazing and it didn't match the price. Aka, everything was overpriced. The sushi was just as good of quality of Sugarfish but twice as expensive. We were joking halfway through the meal that we would have to pick up food somewhere else on the way home because it wasn't filling. It was a good experience but I think it's overrated and all about the name/brand."
2023-12-08,5,"I went to Nobu for my birthday lunch and I can say that my expectations, while initially high, were blown away!The food was absolutely divine, but what really made my experience spectacular was our wonderful server Kardell! He was a genuinely kind, wonderful presence who elevated our experience up to 11/10He gave us the option to give him a price point, he asked some questions on what type of food we enjoy, and he picked the menu for us! It was to die for, would highly recommend"
2023-12-06,4,"One of my Favorite place! Foods, ambiance, customer service, very friendly people. The same service with Malibu farm!"
2023-12-05,5,"Everything is always amazing. Favorites are king crab amazu tempura, spicy tuna, yellowtail jalapeño, new style salmon sashimi"
2023-12-03,5,"I called exactly one month before our desired reservation date at 10am and waited 20 minutes to make the reservation. They have locations across the world but this location in Malibu is the only one where you have to call to make a reservation instead of doing it online.When I was making a reservation I was told the dress code was ""casual and nothing you'd wear to the gym or the beach"". This location is on PCH so you can park along the street or do valet parking for $15. It's right by the beach which means amazing beach and ocean views.FLUKE SASHIMI WITH DRY MISO AND YUZU ($34) - oh man this was like a flavor bomb. This was so good and I loved the crunch. 5/5YELLOWTAIL SASHIMI JALAPEÑO ($34) - our server told us to eat the sashimi with the cilantro and it really did make a difference. The yellowtail was fresh with a slight spice from the jalapeño. 4/5EGGPLANT SPICY MISO ($18) - I first tried this at the Newport Beach location and I really liked it so I had to get it here. Be careful because it's really hot when it comes out. 5/5CRISPY BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($16) - this might just look like standard brussels sprouts but there was a bit of yuzu and spice in it. This was a good dish and we needed some veggies. 4/5BLACK COD WITH MISO ($46) - I loved this dish! The fish was so soft and the miso was so good. This is a must-try. 5/5RIBEYE WITH TRUFFLE BUTTER SAUCE ($56) - the truffle butter was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and was even better with the fried onions. My only complaint was that there wasn't more! I was scooping up the last of the fried onions and scooping all the sauce too. 5/5SALMON AVOCADO ROLL ($15) - this dish sounded simple but it was really good. The rice was sweet and the roll was flavorful. 4.5/5NOBU SIDECAR ($22) - this was a decent drink and was spirit forward. 3.5/5MANGO & PASSION MARTINI ($21) - this was really refreshing and was my favorite drink of all the ones we ordered. 5/5PALOMA BLANCA ($22) - this was also refreshing and had big grapefruit flavors. It was clear so I think it might have been clarified? 4.5/5My favorites were the ribeye with truffle butter sauce, black cod with miso, and fluke sashimi. If you come here I'd highly recommend getting these dishes, but all the dishes were good and had great flavors.I liked that I didn't need to yell to talk to the people at my table but I couldn't hear the tables next to me. The ambiance was great and the music was energetic such that I felt like I was in a club (in a positive way).This is a famous hot spot for a reason. The location, the ambiance, the views, the food, and the drinks are all outstanding here."
2023-12-03,2,Price is too much for sushi that is in the upper middle class of best sushi I have had... I pay 36% more here for the same amount of food and it is not even as good as blue ribbon in the palisades! Like why so expensive they mark it up to much for what it is compared to everywhere else and they treat celebrities better than regular customers so I give it 3 stars my lowest review due to price. You guys have to make it cheaper it's not cool. The view is nice but not nice enough for the food to bankrupt me.
2023-12-01,5,"Another fan girl post and checking this off my bucket list!!  Being brought to Nobu for a client lunch - PRICELESS!!This place has it on lock. Not only the the scenery the best around, the service is great and the flavors are even better!  So fresh and light - at not stuffy or hoity toity at all! You kinda' gotta' love seafood, which is one of the reasons I've wanted to dine here, so badly. I'm so glad I finally got the chance!  And amazingly, you don't feel guilt eating fish while staring at the beautiful Pacific (haha)!It's a must, if even just once. You won't be sorry!"
2023-11-29,4,The food is good. Nobu has a great location and very nice atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's extremely difficult to get a decent reservation. I guess that's the price you pay for being at the top of your game.
2023-11-28,1,"Quality of food has dramatically gone down since the pandemic .  It also feels like a meat market for thirsty singles trying to hook up. This used to be a classy place , now it just feels like management doesn't care . To top it off when my wife is there I have strange men approaching my table asking for her information . Trash , just trash ."
2023-11-28,5,Good food ( ) black cod sushi dessert cocktail Good serviceM actually come here every week !!!
2023-11-27,2,"Table was ready when I arrived with my family for a much anticipated reservation.  The server was informed that my daughter was allergic to all nuts and they said that would not be an issue and that the menu had very few nuts in it.  We had some delicious apps and one of them was a king crab salad.  Unfortunately, this dish had pine nuts and my daughter had an allergic reaction and she said her throat felt like it was closing.  Had to leave immediately, dose her with Benadryl and keep the epi pen handy as we raced back to LA.  The manager did tell us just to leave and not worry about the food the apps.  Just a warning for future diners that the Nobu is a nice place, but they are careless with allergies, so have your guard up."
2023-11-25,5,As always super amazed kat was and always is super nice and really helpful I have been coming here for over 13 years and she doesn't stop to amaze us. The food is unbelievable as always fresh and delicious the service is superb always being attentive wow had the waygu meet amazing also had the mango martini and the fruity passion fruit sake it was great will always say my favorite place and will keep on coming here.
2023-11-23,1,"Alexa needs major training on customer service and has worst attitude. Alexa needs to spoken about regarding her rude behavior, arrogance, and inability to look at guests while speaking to look inconvenienced. Being in the restaurant business I would never hire a person like this for any of my restaurants and especially for a hostess who interacts with guests- unacceptable to have a person like this in the front. Never had a bad experience at any other Nobu restaurants The wait staff were all amazing and very attentive. Kudos to the excellent waitstaff, but need a better hostess"
2023-11-16,5,"Amazing! Fancy vibe and spacial design, Service 12 from 10 ! Food one by one more tasty and spacial ! Love it They was thinking about everything formaking the must fancy and amazing vibe's and service and food."
2023-11-12,5,"I LOVED this place. Definitely lives up to the hype. The overall view you get here during sunset it amazing for pictures and memories. The Dover Sole, Truffle Scallop Chips, and A5 wagyu are my favorite dishes! The Shishito peppers & okra were definitely also a favorite"
2023-11-12,5,"Consistently exceptional service complements the breathtaking views, creating an atmosphere that is truly unparalleled. Highly recommended for those seeking an exquisite evening experience."
2023-11-11,5,"Needless to say but I still wanna thank the service and the chefs for the incredible work. Every time I come to Nobu I'm trying something new on their menu and it's all been a fabulous experience. Truly Japanese food, attitude, attention to details and more to that it's always super clean unlike lots of LA restaurants."
2023-11-09,4,The food was... okay. Prob something you can find at dozens of other sushi places. Just know when you are going here you are paying for the scene and the view.  Nothing wrong with that. Just know what you are paying for. Service wise I was surprised how knowledgeable our server was about the drinks.  Got an amazing Vesper not to be confused with the vespertine.
2023-11-07,4,"Beautiful view! Food is okay, I have been to Nobu in Vegas (Caesar's and the virgin) Miami, LA and Mexico City and taste wise my favorite of all has been the one in Mexico the Polanco location.Service was great! Friendly servers, I didn't reserve, I walked in and they were able to accommodate me.Overall 8 out of 10"
2023-11-06,5,"Best food I had in a while, the service was great and it was worth every penny. The ambiance was great as well. Great view great food good times."
2023-11-05,5,This is definitely a treat yo self spot and a place to see and be seen. Fantastic food and service was top notch! Would love to come here more often but my wallet begs to differ - expect to spend ~$300 for two people.
2023-11-05,4,"Lovely vibes, took care of my wife and I ensuring every plate and drink ordered was near perfect. Cant wait to come back for our next anniversary. Skal!"
2023-10-31,4,Great drinks with nice view of the ocean.   Was nit impressed with the food especially considering prices are high.
2023-10-30,5,"Went to Nobu for lunch & had an amazing time! Nobu really can't miss in my eyes, everything was fantastic from the oysters to the steaks! Went to celebrate a young king's birthday, and had an incredible time! The restaurant has some of the best view in the city, such a perfect vibe! Service was phenomenal - even with the server switch in between dining."
2023-10-28,3,"Food is ok, for the price you'd expect something amazing. But I guess what you are paying for is the view. I don't like omakase because I tend to not like all the sushi the chef decides so I ordered a variety off the menu and I think it was a good insight into the menu. The only thing I highly recommend is the pumpkin cream brûlée though. ( seasonal I believe) Bartenders ARE GREAT! Staff is fast and friendly! Honestly, service is the only reason I would come back here. I came on a day the weather was great and the view was good but it's just like any beach front view. Ambiance, they make Malibu nobu so prestigious and special so it does give off that vibe. Yelling irasyaimasen once in a while is kind of weird? Either everyone should do it like Japan or none, one voice at a time throughout the venue gives off very JINYA ramen vibes."
2023-10-28,5,"5 glorious stars all around. Service was fantastic, the view is incredible, the food--a culinary masterpiece. What a meal!"
2023-10-25,3,"First off, our server James was cool. He was patient, kind, light hearted and gave great service. Thank you, James. This was my third time dining at Nobu Malibu and it was just ok. To get a reservation, you must call 30 days in advance and not a day sooner.  I had to wait on hold for almost an hour SMH. Ok, got the reservation, told them it was for my wedding anniversary. We were seated inside and not on the patio or even near the patio. Bummer. But ok. We came for the food and were strangely underwhelmed. We ordered chocolate martinis (pass on these-they were very ok), margaritas (delicious), Dover Sole w/crispy spinach, Nobu Fish & Chips, Lobster & Shrimp w/lemon sauce, spicy tuna over crispy rice ( this was by far the worst thing we ordered) and the little gem salad. The sole was tangy and tasty. The spinach was cooked perfectly. The fish & chips were just ok. Hubby loved his shrimp & lobster and the salad looked like it was made with minimal effort. The spicy tuna was pasty and so disappointing.  We've enjoyed dining at Nobu Newport, LA, Vegas and I was shocked that the Malibu location was so underwhelming. The interior reminds me of Duke's or El Torito. If you're able to score a table closer to the water, perhaps the view will make it worth the trip. But sitting inside, having ZERO acknowledgment of our anniversary, meh decor and very basic food didn't give us the world class dining experience we've come to associate with Nobu."
2023-10-17,5,Very happy with the customer service we had with our waiter James! He was super kind and helpful when we asked any questions. His suggestions were amazing and we were pleased with our dishes. The food runners explained what was in all of our entrees. Great experience if you want fine dining. This was such a great birthday dinner!
2023-10-13,5,Idk what can be said. It's the BEST. Food. View. Service.  and ! Have gone 3 times the past week if that says ANYTJING at all.
2023-10-12,5,"Food: A, excellent quality and great presentation.Service: A, waitress was friendly,helpful and attentive.Cleanliness: A, Restaurant , bar , lobby and patio were clean and organized. Bathroom was clean and well stocked.Ambiance: A, It can not get any better then this."
2023-10-12,5,"The ambiance and vibe here on a Sunday afternoon is my favorite thing to do on the weekend; The view of the ocean is serene, The food is so fresh it taste like I caught it myself, spicy tuna crispy rice a must as well as the yellowtail sashimi; Also love the big bathroom with the large mirrors"
2023-10-09,1,"The one star is for the delicious food.4:00pm Reservation on a MondayI will preface this review by saying I am an experienced Michelin star server dining with my friend, an accomplished GM, and 2 other restaurant professionals. We are easy because we understand. The service from the second I walked in was so shocking, I thought I was dining at the Cheesecake Factory. Hostess was rude and not smiling. We misspoke our reservation name and she wouldn't give us the other option with that first name for ""privacy"". Sure. Seated:We were greeted with water and was given no menu. Then one menu appeared that only one of our four guests could see. I had to ask for a menu- no one noticed that maybe we needed 4 menus and not one. I asked our server for scissors to cut a tag off my shirt very nicely and he gave zero fucks. He never came back. New server approaches ""Hi your server just went on break, let me know if you need anything"" then scurries off. So basically the sweaty server that greeted us went on break at 4:00pm only to leave right after his break and before we finish. That means we had 3 servers. Our drinks take a long time as well as appetizers. All I could hear is chaos behind me at the server station. Not once did a server refill my water without asking nor did anyone ask if I would like a drink. I had an empty wine glass for several minutes and my drink was bussed without asking if I would like another one. They gave no pizaz over the menu, no intro, no description whatsoever about the menu and this was my first time there!They were more concerned about finishing their last table before bouncing. It was an awful experience, ESPECIALLY FOR NOBU! JUST WAIT IT GETS WORSE.Not only are we trying to enjoy this beautiful day on the beach with friends we havent seen in 6 years and we are spending a lot of money. Heck, we wanted to spend more money! But these servers did not upsell, did not ask  us for more food until they told us we needed to finish our ribeye quickly because there was another reservation coming in. I could not believe it. Here we are in mid bite and they say your time is up, wrap it up!  Especially when they were the ones that took forever!!!! I CANNOT!Not only were we still hungry leaving but they made us feel so incredibly unwelcome I am still in shock this was NOBU that I was dining at. The servers are incredibly under-qualified and made our experience awful. I am so disappointed in how we were treated after spending a lot of money. No management to oversee this complete ridiculous ""transition phase"".Look i get it because I am a server, But we had 3 servers come and try to get us to leave basically it was so obnoxious. They said "" you guys wanna order any more food"" its like, why dont you try to recommend something???? By the end of our last dish we had empty wine glasses and plates everywhere and they were so concerned to get US OUT I felt emotional about it. The worst customer service ever. And listen, of course we didnt complain because we just wanted to enjoy ourselves, but we sure did bitch about it later! NOBU Hire some servers that are not just there for the money who have experience and you might get a better review. *Rude hosts- made it a big deal when i asked for scissors. Was not accommodating and pleasant*No intro about the menu they were order takers ready to go home.* I was never asked for another glass of wine when it was finished, nor was it bussed off my table*Had to constantly ask for more water, sometimes 2 times before receiving* Was rushed to finish our dinner exactly 90 minutes from seating * No upsell, no table maintenance, no FUCKS GIVEN* NO smiles, no intro, no menu guiding.* RUSHED and rude overall"
2023-10-06,5,If you're looking for a place for brunch with a view... this is my go-to. Love this place!
2023-10-03,5,A good view for dinner along the beach side. I have been to the one in Dallas and was disappointed. Malibu definitely made me changed my mind!The workers were very attentive and nice. We got good recommendations and drinks. Thank you for making sure we were satisfied.  The shrimp tempura was absolutely the best and fave! Ended with two dessert instead of one because we couldn't decide
2023-10-03,1,"I waited nearly an hour to get through to make a reservation over the phone. The hostess was short, rude, and disconnected the call without making a reservation or attempting to call me back. This place has a horrible business practice for making reservations and clearly doesn't valuing their clientele. Shame on the management of Nobu Malibu."
2023-10-01,1,"the price of food is a joke! $8 for a tiny piece of salmon sashimi it's simply insane. The servers are always clinging the tables up, it was the only good thing I saw."
2023-09-26,1,"It is ridiculously expensive mediocre food. Frankly, for that price we could've eaten in a better, more modernly designed sushi restaurant in the valley. Plus, every minute some new server will come and ask if we are doing ok. Please, leave people alone, and assign one server per table and let him stand there and only approach the table if called. It wouldn't hurt to upgrade that old brown furniture too."
2023-09-22,5,"It's been 10 years since we last visited Nobu Malibu and while we loved it back then, we LOVE it even more now!Both visits were to celebrate my mom's birthday and it went off without a hitch! We had 12:15 reservations and walked in a few minutes before and were sat right away. We didn't have to ask but were still given an excellent table on the outer deck with a perfect view of the ocean. We even saw dolphins that made lunch so much better.I can't recall our waitress' name but her and the whole wait-staff who assisted us were absolutely incredible. Kind, attentive, fast and hardworking, and really made it a better experience.We loved all but one item we ordered. To get that out of the way - the baked crab cut roll was really no big deal. My mom, and all of us for that, love baked crab rolls and sadly this was just kinda bland and not really warm.Besides that, everything else was perfection. I started with the Nobu original sake that was sharp, bold, and slightly sour with a refreshing note.For the dishes, we first received the Seared Toro with truffle teriyaki. WOW. The toro was so buttery and fatty while the sauce and crunchy mushrooms were beyond amazing. I want that mushroom ""salad"" as a whole dish because we devoured that.Next up was the Nobu Style scallops - made like ceviche with thick slices of scallop in a delicious sauce and the scallops so tender and soft. Next up the Tiradito salmon was phenomenal, another melt-in-your-mouth dish. Not fishy and a light sauce that paired so well.The creamy spicy snow crab had an amazing sauce, not too spicy, but creamy and rich with soft juicy crab underneath it. This comes to the table sizzling hot!The black cod with miso is always a must, did you even go to Nobu if you didn't order this? So flaky, soft, buttery, slightly sweet, and oh so good. BTW, that tempura eggplant needs to be a dish of its own too.One of the biggest surprises for us was the short rib - holy shit. This is a godsend dish. The meat came out so soft and tender with plenty of juices soaked into the heart of palm puree. The meat was charred so well for a crispy crust. Wow.  This is a new favorite.Unagi (eel) nigiri was thick, crispy, fatty, sweet, savory - so tasty.And lastly, the rock shrimp was crispy, saucy, creamy, shrimpy, another must have.Nobu is, hands down, an LA must."
2023-09-19,5,"Great food and service was excellent. Very difficult to get a reservation. Also, the passion fruit martini was delicious!"
2023-09-18,5,Everything is beautiful about this place the ambience the customer service the food. The last to get together I had a year ago around my birthday. The steak was amazing.
2023-09-17,5,"The ambiance and view were amazing, we had a great experience our first time out @ Nobu. Besides the craziness trying to get a drink @ the bar we had a great evening and enjoyed the dishes immensely. The service was top notch as we expected."
2023-09-15,5,"The ambiance of this Nobu location is just perfect. Along side the Malibu beaches coast line where you can enjoy the view and the delicious food. Ate here for lunch on a Thursday after noon 1:45 pm, made the reservation 1 month in advance. I suggest calling at 10 Am when they open their reservations line and they take appointments the month ahead, another option is to add yourself on the waitlist for the time and date you want and you'll be notified if there's any availability.I was torn between doing Omakase or ordering a bunch of cut rolls and appetizer. We decided to order the cut rolls. My favorite was the Spicy Tuna Cut roll and the Yellowtail Jalapeño cut roll. So yummy. For the Appe-teaser got the Rock Shrimp tempura with the sauce on the side.Great service. Price came out to be $177 for what we ordered which wasn't too bad! If your a Nobu and Sushi fan you'll def wanna check this restaurant location out !Happy dining !"
2023-09-13,2,"I finally made it to the upscale Japanese restaurant Nobu in Malibu. The service was excellent, the ambience also good and the ocean view delightful. As to the food very disappointing and outrageously priced. I misread the menu and ordered my favorite, yellow tail Sashmi thinking 2 pieces were $9.00, but each piece was $9.00, thinly sliced. The salmon skin hand roll was stuffed with everything but salmon skin. The soft-shell crab roll was again obscured by other ingredients. My local sushi restaurant outshines this elite eatery by miles. The 2 men sitting next to us ordered the tasting menu at $130 each and seemed very pleased. If you have extra cash in your pocket and want a great view and superior service by all means visit Nobu. For me the food is more important."
2023-09-12,4,"The food is good here but for the prices, it's not worth it. You can get better flavours elsewhere for cheaper. However, ocean views are amazing with beautiful breeze and sunsets."
2023-09-10,3,"The ambiance was top tier!! The food was very mediocre for the price. The drinks were bomb. The ""Caesar"" salad was not Caesar. In fact it was very spicy and we were not expecting that. The tempura rock shrimp was like a knock off bang bang shrimp but the sauce was almost citrus like. The king crab tempura was fire! We wished we would've just each gotten that instead."
2023-09-10,5,Great food and ambiance But don't come here hungry lolRock shrimp tempura and the albacore with lemon is very good. We loved the lobster and steak tacos. The waiter said the lobster dish was huge but really just looked big bc of the empty shells. Idk how much lobster there was either bc we had mostly tempura veggies. He told us we can Alyssa take it home if we don't finish it but we cleaned the plate
2023-09-09,5,"I absolutely loved this place. Reservations are difficult to get. We were number 45 on the waitlist on the phone. The wait was so long, I didn't have the patience to wait. We were in the area and although the parking lot was packed, we stopped and asked if there were any openings. Thankfully the hostess said they had one last table for four available.First I want to say, the restaurant was busy! Every table was occupied. We were sat inside but the restaurant opens up to the outside and we were able to enjoy the beautiful view while enjoying our meal.Now let me get to the meal. Sushi on the menu seems run of the mill. The waiter made a point to say that their sushi is amazing and fresh but their specialty is the hot menu so of course we had to order from both.The sushi was pretty amazing. The hot food was pretty amazing. The entire meal was pretty amazing. I also had 2 cocktails and asked for extra lichees which were happily provided.If planning to be in Malibu, plan ahead and make reservations. We were lucky, you may not be!"
2023-09-08,5,"Nobu never disappoints. My girlfriend and I have been going here for years and are always extremely happy. The artichoke salad is one of our favorites, and the A-5 Wagyu sushi is the best of the best."
2023-09-07,5,"If you want fresh delicious food come to nobu ! It's amazing and the service is incredible, it's overall amazing and the ambiance is the cherry on top . Just exquisite !"
2023-09-06,1,"Just want to say couple of things about hostess. I usually come here 3-4 times a month, the girls are very unpleasant, poor customer service, can never accommodate unless you are famous. Tables are usually available but they still make you wait over an hour to seat you, and after all seat you at the empty table that no one sat for over an hour. Cat is RUDE and has ZERO customer service!!! Makes you not want to come back!!!"
2023-09-06,1,"The food is ok. After spending something like 5k here over two consecutive days with our industry friends and clients, on a Sunday evening when we'd finished our meal and had dessert and were packing up we were asked to leave due to a 90 minute allotted mealtime. We actually were just getting ready to leave and there were at least ten open tables. Not only will we never come back, our industry friends won't either. I've never been asked to leave approximately 91 minutes after spending 3k on ok food. Bui Sushi is better if you want sushi in Malibu without the hassle or attitude."
2023-09-05,5,"I had a splendid dining experience at Nobu in Malibu! I ordered the Omakase (Chef's tasting menu) and it was exceptional! I will definitely return on my next visit to LA and order the Omakase again! It included sashimi, sushi, soup, a seafood and meat entree and dessert. Also, with each course the waitress would provide an overview and tell you the order to eat the food in! It was amazing! The restaurant is also right by the beach and offers spectacular views!"
2023-09-04,4,"Absolutely beautiful restaurant right on the Malibu ocean! Incredible views & variety of seating options inside & outside. Of course its Nobu, so expect high prices, busy atmosphere & celebrity sightings.. But worth it to try once if you are able :)Food & Drink - loved all of the cocktails we tried, fish was all fresh & delicious - so many great plates & options to choose from!Service - very attentive & food came out incredibly fast.Ambiance - beautiful ocean views, crowded restaurants with tables fairly close together, overall just a trendy place to go but definitely an experience to have!!"
2023-09-03,5,Absolutely delicious food & great service. We couldn't get enough of the yellow tail or caviar tacos
2023-08-29,5,"Food was delicious, obviously priced higher than similar quality food at other restaurants, but you're paying for the ambience and ocean views. I called 2 days before I wanted to go and got a 2:45 pm lunch for 4 ppl due to a cancellation. Food we tried:Tiradito - delicious, fresh and citrusy yellowtail jalapeño- deliciousBlack cod miso- delicious, tender Rock shrimp- not bad but not amazing, kindof standard what you would expect Cocktails! So delicious and exceeded expectations, for example the mango passionfruit martini- you could tell they use real passionfruit juice as it smelled so fresh. -kinobi jalapeño cocktail was so good, 10/10Overall, definitely worth going once to experience the beautiful oceanfront dining, or again for a special occasion! For me, I wouldn't return just for the food due to the price."
2023-08-26,5,"Great food, beautiful wine selection, outstanding service and unforgettable view! Must visit, I enjoy it every time"
2023-08-25,1,"overrated restaurant with mediocre sushi for a premium. you would think for $300 per person you'd get top shelf fresh sushi -- spoiler alert you don't. i don't know what's so exclusive about this place, the times I came in person on a whim and asked if they have availability I was seated immediately. the times i've called, they said they were fully committed. they clearly seat me because I dress to the nines, and clearly a model. however, the patrons dining dress and act like they are at Applebees. after my recent visit tuesday night -- only because it was the only place still open for dinner, I never plan to return. it's great that the servers change your plate every 5 minutes -- though pointless when I have a drop of soy sauce -- their eel was dry, the salmon was not top shelf, and the waitress kept giving us one order of each when we requested 2. I recommend you visit shintaro in hollywood -- it's more of a ""hole in the wall"" compared to Nobu, but their sushi is top shelf and exceptional service"
2023-08-23,1,"Reservations are impossible to get as they favor celebrities over regular customers. We were told to call at 10 am exactly one month prior to the day we wanted to reserve. We called at exactly 10 am and were on hold for ONE HOUR. At 11 am we finally got through and were told we ""missed our chance"" and we should have been quicker. How can one be quicker if we called exactly at 10 am? The lady on the phone offered no sympathy and just gave us attitude when we kindly brought up our frustration. Do not bother dining here. It has just become a status symbol for who can get in or not, not an actual restaurant."
2023-08-23,1,Just waited on hold for over an hour to make a reservation and when the person got on the line they hung up on me.
2023-08-21,1,"They disrespect you. How? By not giving you a table unless you have connections. If you go on line the minute the windows open, it says there are no availability! How?? You call and have to be on hold for an hour and they'll say there are no openings. How's that even possible? It's not like you'll dine there for free if you have no connections. But why all their time slots are taken is because they purposely block all their time slots so they can give it to those who want a reservation through their connections. This is very disrespectful and insulting. How is it possible that there are never ever any time slots open online or when you call in? There are a lot of politics involved when it comes to Nobu Malibu. All their other locations is easy to get in except for this one. And that's all because you have to go through so many channels and I do not appreciate it. I have made reservations at the best restaurants in Paris and I was able to do so fairly easily within a week or two in advanced as required. That is not acceptable!"
2023-08-21,1,Made a reservation a month ago for my 87 birthday! I have always had nobu malibu in my bucket list! We had the worst server ever! I think we saw him twice and had to call for him and look for him to get refills on iced tea hot tea and a fork! He disappeared! Then the portion sizes if the delicious black cod and sea bass were so small for the huge price it was outrageous! The salmon and yelliw tail rolls were good also. The place was half empty for lunch and we were seated inside! My husband is 92 and my son who paid is a very famous doctor. We were very disappointed except that the food was good. People pay for the view but we didn't have any!
2023-08-19,1,"I called a month ago to reserve a table when I came she told me there is no reservation and there is a waiting list and I have to wait an hour and 15 minutes, after an hour she said it will take another an hour and she lied about the time line we was given she said she told us the waiting list is 2 hours , everyone was very rude and doesn't tried to help us . For the price they charge for this experience I was expecting for a good customer service bot no , there is a very expensive restaurant with 0 understandable of customer service, they have a lot to learn ."
2023-08-19,5,Date night go to. Had an amaizng tofu dish that was off menu last night ask the server is seared w a spicy tomato marinade. Service perfect as always and was not over crowded for a Friday in summer. Valet could not be faster. I love their veggie roll but get it w out the carrot bc it's marinated or like pickled and that's too weird for me haha! My husband got the yellowtail jalepeno roll for the first time and it's as good as their famous yellowtail jalepeno sashimi honestly like the iteration of that classic popular nobu dish he said was on point. We probably should go here less but it's our fave in malibu and our go to date spot. Ryan the manager is one of the nicest sweetest humans you will EVER MEET. He is the best best best
2023-08-18,1,We came in from the beach manager was rude af as she told us our beach attire wasn't expectable despite them being located on the beach
2023-08-17,5,"The best service views to die for and the food is incomparable hands down the drinks and desserts are so adventurous and delightful. We come here at least once a year and we feel it's worth the drive and the $$$ to be here amongst the best of the best in food service and ambiance, don't miss this one, you have to experience this at least once in a life time!"
2023-08-16,5,"As busy as Nobu is, this place is never a mess with their drink and food. It get super crazy busy on the weekends specially, during summer but if you wait it out long enough, you're able to find somewhere to sit at the bar or they even have the option to take a drink out on their front deck if you're going to try and have like a little snack in the bar. Such a fun, high energy location especially in Malibu not to say you can't be super dress down but if you're in beach clothes, it's not an issue, but just make sure that your attire is tasteful."
2023-08-13,4,"Beautiful view for sure... But if you know Cali weather.. it gets cold in the evening even in the summer so be prepared. They do have blankets you can ask for but those are limited. First time here and of course I've heard all the hype. While everything tasted good a fresh I wasn't overly impressed. Some menu items I have at other restaurants that practically taste the same without the price tag. The salmon special was ok.. seared and placed on a platter with some sort of sauce.. the sauce was a bit thick. Not typical for sushi. (Wouldn't order again) and I LOVE salmon sushi. Also got the rock shrimp! Very good, would order two depending on the party size.. but, I've had the same meal elsewhere. The crispy shiitake salad was very good, I don't think I would have ordered it but someone at my table did and it was good! The Toro was amazing! And the Nobu roll was just okay.. would not order again but I finished it cuz I paid for it lol. Can't go wrong with Black Cod Miso but it wasn't as tender as I'm used to. I'd definitely like to return and try other menu items or even experience their Omakase"
2023-08-11,3,"My HUSBAND & I came here for lunch to celebrate our marriage! We literally planned this for awhile as this restaurant was really high on my list. We literally left the courthouse & pulled up for our reservation. I literally had on all white with a purse that said ""BRIDE"". Although I told the hostess that we got married that day in my reservation it was not acknowledged. We ordered to champagnes immediately which took forever to receive. We let both waiters know we were trying to celebrate our marriage & could someone check on our drinks since it had been like 15 minutes to get our drinks. All we got was an ""Oh congrats!"". Cold food came out quickly. We ordered spicy tuna, albacore nigiri, okra, ribeye & lobster taco, field green salad, ribeye with truffle butter & salmon nigiri. We also ordered the sliders but they were never received. We received short rib instead which must have been a miscommunication. The high we were on literally kind of got rained on with service. It is what it is. Maybe I'm a brat but a little more customer service would have went a long way on our special day. Food was honestly not mind blowing & extremely overpriced as expected. But it is absolutely beautiful! So if you want to visit for aesthetics go for it! Definitely sad that IMO this place is overhyped."
